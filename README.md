# Docs Checker

Have you ever worked on a project where little if any documentation existed? Do you find yourself constantly trying to "just write stuff down" so that future you, the rest of your team, or whoever replaces you when you rage quit can benefit from that knowledge someday?

Well boy do I have the GitHub App for you! ;) Docs Checker attempts to nudge contributors to write documentation when creating pull requests via basic rules.

## Comments and Checks

The app configuration is controlled through the `.github/docs-checker.yml` file added to your repo. Via that file you can choose to enable nudging people through comments or ruining their day through failed checks.
